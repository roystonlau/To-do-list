# To do list
 This is my first project using what we have learnt from module 1 of the course.

Some of the features that the "to do list" must have :-
-Allow strikethrough when the user click on the task - done!
-Remove button for each task - done!
- If I have more time:- 
-try to create a way for user to sort the list 
- Add more transition effect - done!
